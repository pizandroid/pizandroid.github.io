        <b>Starting from version 1.10.7 published in the Play Store on 03/03/2019, Call Filter Alarm is retired. Although the app becomes useless, it still uses the following permissions to work until the user is warned of the deactivation that occurs with the update (in case the update happens during sleep mode enabled).<br>
        In a future update, all permissions will be removed and Call Filter Alarm will be totally useless. 
        Even if Call Filter Alarm is no longer supported, since this version still uses the permissions, the privacy policy is still available.
